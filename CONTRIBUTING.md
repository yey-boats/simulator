# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in `yey-boats-simulator`.

## License of contributions

This project is source-available under the [PolyForm Noncommercial License
1.0.0](LICENSE) and is **dual-licensed**: the maintainer also offers commercial
licenses (see [COMMERCIAL.md](COMMERCIAL.md)). For that to work, every
contribution must come with the right to include it under both the noncommercial
and the commercial license.

We use the **Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)** — no separate CLA to sign.
Certify each commit by adding a `Signed-off-by` line:

```
git commit -s -m "your message"
```

which appends:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

By signing off you agree to the DCO below. Use your real name and a reachable
email. PRs whose commits are not signed off cannot be merged.

## Developer Certificate of Origin 1.1

```
By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right
    to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my
    knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the
    right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether
    created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless
    I am permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who
    certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public and
    that a record of the contribution (including all personal information I submit
    with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be
    redistributed consistent with this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

## Development

Preferred (reproducible — installs from the committed `uv.lock`):

```
uv sync --frozen --extra dev
uv run pytest -q
uv run ruff check src tests
uv run mypy
# frontend
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build
```

Without uv:

```
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest -q
ruff check src tests
mypy
# frontend
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build
```

If you add/change a dependency in `pyproject.toml`, regenerate the lockfile
with `uv lock` and commit `uv.lock`.
